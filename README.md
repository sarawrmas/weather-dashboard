# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
This website allows the user to look up weather data by city name. When a search is submitted, you are presented with the current date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. If the UV index is favorable, this is indicated by green, moderate conditions turn yellow, and severe conditions turn red. A five day forecast is also presented with temperature, wind, and humidity. Once a user searches for a city, it is added to a list that can then be clicked to look at that city's weather conditions again.
